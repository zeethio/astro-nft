            "saturn": "Traditionally, the eighth house was recognized as the house of death. Saturn in the eighth in a natal chart would mean a horrible death. Modern day astrologers have moved away from that line of thinking. Today we think of the eighth house as a house of resurrections. The eighth house symbolizes transformations through growth and change. As an individual, you might need to re-invent yourself from time to time. The eighth house is opposite the second house, which symbolizes your attitude to possessions. In that sense the eighth house stands for your attitude to giving up relics of the past, so you can grow and change. Saturn in the eighth house can be a powerful influence. This influence will make you simply resist transformations, change, and growth. You will find it very difficult to accept changes in your life. Any change will be stressful for you, bringing in anxiety and worry. Be aware of this influence. Understand that change is something that you do not react to well. Prepare for change. Take time to chart out a course or action plan whenever change is imminent. Read a book on managing change in your life or at work. Change, if managed well, can make your life richer and better.",

You are a philosophical sort, interested and curious about the world, other people, and perhaps different cultures. You can be extremely restless and discontented if you do not have a definite goal in mind. You might find yourself longing to be somewhere else when you are unhappy, imagining that if you were to move or travel, you would be much happier. However, this attitude can only keep you from enjoying and improving upon the situation you are now in, only serving to make you feel more unhappy in the present and with your current circumstances. Trying to avoid the attitude that the grass is greener on the other side will be important, while attending to your needs to get away from time to time will help scratch the seemingly incurable itch for something more. You may have done extensive traveling in your early years, or in some way had a background which enables you to understand and identify with many different types of people or cultures. You have a craving for things which are far away and foreign or for things you have never experienced before. You want to completely immerse yourself in the feelings and tastes of a new place, rather than simply have facts or an intellectual appreciation. Emotionally, too, you are restless and something of a wanderer.",

You get off on how information affects peoples lives, and you take great pleasure in learning that something you have shared or taught has inspired others to take action, experience something new, or make changes in their lives. Some of you might be too quick to offer advice, however, that might be lacking in thoroughness and practicality, or that you yourself do not follow.

In fact, you have a great love for the feeling of freedom or limitlessness. Your hips and thighs may be especially attractive! You appreciate a lover who is enthusiastic and not afraid to have a good time (with you!). You aspire to high ideals in love, but some of you might pursue sensations in love rather than true or deep feelings and attachment. Beware of a tendency for dissatisfaction with what you have, as the tendency to think that the grass is greener elsewhere can keep you from enjoying or developing what you have.",

This position has a Sagittarian flavor. Watch for a tendency to become angry or hurt if others disagree with you, as it can be all too easy to take differences of opinion very personally. As well, in your enthusiasm to uncover truths, you may be a little too pushy. You are sexually playful and energetic, and you may approach sex as a sport at times. Honest and sometimes downright blunt, others find your sense of humor and direct approach attractive. Your hearty laugh is appealing, and your zest for life is unmistakable.

The ninth house signifies an individual&lsquo;s personal philosophy of life, perception of the reality of life, and reaction to new ideas. Saturn in the ninth house indicates a practically minded individual. You are unlikely to take to flights of fantasy or fancy ideas. You might even be closed to new ideas. Your thinking might be overly closed and conservative. Don&lsquo;t close your mind! Be aware that while practicality is a great quality, the world needs people to come up with new ideas in order to move forward or even keep going. Don&lsquo;t dismiss ideas too quickly and don&lsquo;t be threatened by them. Instead, adopt a constructive attitude. Tell yourself and others that you can be practical in your thinking. And, that is an asset. At the same time, encourage people around you to think and act out their ideas and philosophies. You can be close-minded and mean, or the sane anchor of practicality for the creativity around you. The choice is yours!",

You thrive in careers in which you can pioneer, take the lead, or enjoy a certain amount of freedom or independence. You are a self-starter!

            "saturn": "One-to-one relationships are a seventh house function. The eleventh house is best understood as one that governs an individual&lsquo;s one-to-many relationships. This implies your relationship with friends, extended family, and the organization you work for, and so on. Saturn in the eleventh house, therefore, works much in the same way as in the seventh (read Saturn in the seventh), except that the nature of the relationships are different. You may find socializing tiresome and prefer to stay alone. Many people with this position feel some disdain for the superficial workings of casual friendships and of the group — that is, they feel uncomfortable and self-conscious about going through the motions, doing and saying the right things, and so forth. At the root of this perception, there may be a fear of failure in a group setting. It may be easier to fall back on, and take too much pride in, your uniqueness as an individual rather than submit to the idea that you belong and identify with a group. It can be a fear of being ordinary or just part of the crowd that prevents you from loosening up in social situations. The fact that you take friendships more seriously than most can give you a heavy sense of responsibility and reluctance to form ties as if you somehow sense that forming them will burden or obligate you too much. Staying alone might seem to be a better use of your time. Watch out for this. A deep-seated feeling of loneliness and separateness may be the result. Take time to personalize your social interactions. Since you find group activity uncomfortable, develop a few good friends to hang out with. You have a greater capacity than most to be a loyal and long-standing friend! Beyond friendships and groups, the eleventh house is associated with our long-term goals, hopes, and dreams. Saturn here can make you just as reluctant to commit to any one life path, and to articulate or define your innermost wishes, as you are to attach yourself to a group identity. It is as if doing so would be too binding and revealing. When you learn to identify and overcome your fear of failure, you will discover that this fear has been the only thing holding you back from defining and working towards your dreams.",

You are extraordinarily resourceful, and you can handle many things on your own or in uniquely creative ways. When working all alone, you can make your almost impossible dreams come true.
