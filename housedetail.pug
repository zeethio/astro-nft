This activity doesn&lsquo;t necessarily please you but you do it anyways from a sense of responsibility. In that sense the sixth house is Saturnine. When Saturn happens to be in the sixth house of your natal chart you may very well be a workaholic. You may forget that you are working only to make a living. You may fall into the trap of living to work! Avoid doing this. In any case, you will have a strong sense of responsibility in your attitude to work and you will take service to others rather seriously.

You seek emotional fulfillment through relationships, but you may have many relationships one after another, each time believing that this is the one. Taking time between relationships is something that is hard for you to do, but quite necessary, as you tend to jump into relationships out of fear of being alone. You are very adaptable to others needs, and usually quite likeable as a result. Be careful that you do not become overly dependent on a partner, or assume that a partner is going to treat you the same way as you do them. You depend a great deal upon other people for emotional support and you have a large family of friends that care about you and treat you as kin.

You can be quite skilled at keeping a partnership animated and alive with interesting tidbits, new ideas, and stimulating conversation. It is easy for you to become bored in partnership if the lines of communication go down, even temporarily. You might attract partners who are not especially sincere or downright duplicitous. In order to put an end to this pattern, you might try to avoid scheming and overanalyzing in your relationships. You might also love to talk about and analyze relationships and marriage.

Sexual unrest, or an apparent need to constantly change sexual partners or to challenge yourself sexually, may be a symptom of emotional insecurity.

Your charm runs deep just below the surface. You are attracted to all that is taboo, hidden, forbidden, and find beauty in the broken, disenchanted, obsessed, and passionate.

The eighth house is opposite the second house, which symbolizes your attitude to possessions. In that sense the eighth house stands for your attitude to giving up relics of the past, so you can grow and change. Saturn in the eighth house can be a powerful influence. This influence will make you simply resist transformations, change, and growth. You will find it very difficult to accept changes in your life. Any change will be stressful for you, bringing in anxiety and worry. Be aware of this influence. Understand that change is something that you do not react to well. Prepare for change.

Trying to avoid the attitude that the grass is greener on the other side will be important, while attending to your needs to get away from time to time will help scratch the seemingly incurable itch for something more.

You have a craving for things which are far away and foreign or for things you have never experienced before.

Your thinking might be overly closed and conservative. Don&lsquo;t close your mind!

Saturn in the eleventh house, therefore, works much in the same way as in the seventh (read Saturn in the seventh), except that the nature of the relationships are different. You may find socializing tiresome and prefer to stay alone. Many people with this position feel some disdain for the superficial workings of casual friendships and of the group — that is, they feel uncomfortable and self-conscious about going through the motions, doing and saying the right things, and so forth. At the root of this perception, there may be a fear of failure in a group setting. It may be easier to fall back on, and take too much pride in, your uniqueness as an individual rather than submit to the idea that you belong and identify with a group. It can be a fear of being ordinary or just part of the crowd that prevents you from loosening up in social situations. The fact that you take friendships more seriously than most can give you a heavy sense of responsibility and reluctance to form ties as if you somehow sense that forming them will burden or obligate you too much. Staying alone might seem to be a better use of your time. Watch out for this. A deep-seated feeling of loneliness and separateness may be the result. Take time to personalize your social interactions. Since you find group activity uncomfortable, develop a few good friends to hang out with. You have a greater capacity than most to be a loyal and long-standing friend! Beyond friendships and groups, the eleventh house is associated with our long-term goals, hopes, and dreams. Saturn here can make you just as reluctant to commit to any one life path, and to articulate or define your innermost wishes, as you are to attach yourself to a group identity. It is as if doing so would be too binding and revealing. When you learn to identify and overcome your fear of failure, you will discover that this fear has been the only thing holding you back from defining and working towards your dreams.",

You will be blessed with imaginative and vivid creative ideas which can make you a famous and creative writer.With Mars in the twelfth house of the natal chart, you can struggle with asserting yourself in direct, natural ways in your youth, but with time and experience (and perhaps some hard work), you are likely to learn to work with this energy rather than allow it to work against you.  You are extraordinarily resourceful, and you can handle many things on your own or in uniquely creative ways. When working all alone, you can make your almost impossible dreams come true. Watch for a tendency to feel defeated before you have given something a real shot.  Positively you can be very unselfish, working more on behalf of others than for yourself. There is a touch of the incurable romantic in your nature.",

You will be a profound astrologer, meditator and yoga teacher, healer. You  will focus on spirituality which will be your source of wealth and assets, and you will guide others on the path of spiritual beliefs. You are relaxed, confident and hard-working. Solitude, working alone, and meditation can bring you great pleasure and a sense of rejuvenation. You are merciful and generous, often anonymously.You will love to travel, engage in scientific pursuit, buy expensive things and even become great editor. Being free and letting go of the past should be your main focus. see the good in any situation ",

Saturn in this house could mean an early life setback which prompts you to push the realities of life into the unconscious.You are disciplined and sensitive. You don’t want to feel in any way weak or to seem like you are depending on people. You have strong emotions. You may have a great talent for the arts.You will probably become very famous if you’ll learn something having to do with the arts from an early age. While self-control seems to be the most attractive route for you, you might find that letting others inside you, even in little ways, will help you overcome many of the vague feelings of guilt, self-doubt, and anxiety that prevent you from enjoying life in a free and natural manner. Learning to embrace your sorrow, free from guilt, is the first step towards true self-acceptance. ",
